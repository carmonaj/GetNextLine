mock file data = "hello world!\n && hello universe!"

list->content = part of main str


read into list->content

read(fd, list->content, buff_size)
list->content = "hello"

nxt, check if content has nl or EOF
nope
so, read again into nxt node

read(fd, list->content, buff_size)
list->content = " worl"

nxt, check if content has nl or EOF
nope,
so read again into nxt node

read(fd, list->content, buff_size)
list->content = "d!\n &"

nxt, check if content has nl or EOF
yes, content has nl
{
	save pointer from list->content to tmp
	make a new str with "d!"
	set new str pointer to list->content

	make another str for the nl and other characters
	save it in another list for when read is called again
	free old pointer tmp

	iterate through all nodes and join content into one string
	return string
}
